# Prerequisites

For this first project, we will assume that:

* you are a competent Linux user
* who is interested in security and privacy
* who is willing to experiment and break things
* who has control of your home environment
* who has control of your home firewall
* who has control of your home DHCP server
* who understands what "static IP address on the local network" means
* who has a spare RaspberryPi, or similar small Linux instance such as
  a container that can have a static IP address exposed on the local
  network

# Installation

## build your system

I'm using a RaspberryPi with Raspbian Lite, but Ubuntu or Debian on
Linux would also work.

## set your system to have a fixed IP address

If you're not using RaspberryPi, this might be different; but I just
checked my local router non-DHCP address space, picked a suitable free
static address, and then followed the process described
[here](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/how-to-give-your-raspberry-pi-a-static-ip-address-update):

```
sudo vi /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

...and (assuming wifi networking; adjust the interface name if not)
edit or append something like this; see your platform documentation
for correct details.

```
interface wlan0
static ip_address=X.X.X.A/24
static routers=X.X.X.B
static domain_name_servers=X.X.X.C
```

...and then I did `reboot` and checked that the static address was in
place and being used by the RaspberryPi.

Obviously we will be revisiting the value of `domain_name_servers` in
the future.  If you're stuck for a temporary value, use `1.1.1.1` or
`8.8.8.8` for the moment.

## install "tor"

This is easy.  I did:

```
sudo apt install tor
```

...and on Raspbian, at the time of writing, this provides `Tor
0.3.5.8` as shown by `tor -v`.

## configure socks-proxy on tor

Edit `/etc/tor/torrc` and uncomment the line that says:

```
SocksPort 9050 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.
```

## install "dnscrypt-proxy"

[DNSCrypt-proxy](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy) is a
"flexible DNS proxy, with support for modern encrypted DNS protocols
such as DNSCrypt v2, DNS-over-HTTPS and Anonymized DNSCrypt"; it's an
interesting tool to mess around with, and even
[references](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-protocol/blob/master/ANONYMIZED-DNSCRYPT.txt)
some of what we are about to do, in critical terms:

> While the communications themselves are secure, and while the
> stateless nature of the DNSCrypt protocol helps against
> fingerprinting individual devices, DNS server operators can still
> observe client IP addresses.
>
> A common way to prevent this is to use DNSCrypt over Tor or SOCKS
> proxies. However, Tor significantly increases the latency of DNS
> responses. And public SOCKS proxies are difficult to operate, as
> they can easily be abused for purposes unrelated to DNS.

I'm actually okay with this analysis; I consider it to be dated, and
since my work for the past few years has largely consisted of
[disrupting](https://www.facebook.com/notes/protect-the-graph/making-connections-to-facebook-more-secure/1526085754298237/)
[people's](https://open.nytimes.com/https-open-nytimes-com-the-new-york-times-as-a-tor-onion-service-e0d0b67b7482)

[about](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7686)
[Tor](https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett/status/756451264121167872) and
its [performance and usability](https://github.com/alecmuffett/eotk),
where that document says "Tor significantly increases the latency of
DNS responses", I am coming from the perspective of "can we make it
'good enough for most people'?"  In truth *any* extra "hop" is going
to add latency to my DNS resolutions, and I am willing to trade a
little latency for some extra privacy.

DNSCrypt-proxy is a *huge* package, but has a pretty comprehensive
[wiki](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki) to help.

Unfortunately the current (Feb 2020) version of dnscrypt-proxy that is
bundled with Raspbian is too old (`2.0.19`) to be useful; we have to
try to use the precompiled binaries, instead.

Following and abridging the [PiHole instructions](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/DNSCrypt-2.0)
```
sudo -i # get to root; all further commands must run as root
cd /opt
wget https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/releases/download/2.0.44/dnscrypt-proxy-linux_arm-2.0.44.tar.gz
tar xzvf dnscrypt-proxy-linux_arm-2.0.44.tar.gz
rm dnscrypt-proxy-linux_arm-2.0.44.tar.gz
mv linux-arm/ dnscrypt-proxy/
cd dnscrypt-proxy/
echo "# test" > dnscrypt-proxy.toml
chown -R root: ./
./dnscrypt-proxy -service install
./dnscrypt-proxy -service start
```

If you are building on Ubuntu or other platforms, the repositories
(again) seem to be shipping an older version - `2.0.31` on Focal, as
of July 2020; I do not know whether this is recent enough to support
DoHoT, but I can confirm that version `2.0.39` works with some tweaks
to the configuration file, and I now use `2.0.44` as standard.

Please let me know your experiences by logging an `issue` on Github.

## configure dnscrypt-proxy to provide DNS over HTTPS over Tor

DNSCrypt-Proxy requires a configuration file. And example one is
provided, but for DoHot I recommend that you install
[dnscrypt-proxy.toml](dnscrypt-proxy.toml) and amend if necessary.

## set the server to use itself for resolution

Revisiting `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`, ensure that the DNS configuration line
looks something like:

```
static domain_name_servers=X.X.X.C
```

...if you used a temporary, other DNS server.

## reboot to check that everything works

`sudo reboot`
